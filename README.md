### _**Description**_
Years ago, we would have scoffed at the idea too. 

However...in light of current events, validated, vetted testimonials and declassified government cables & documents _and_ confirmed UAP Footage captured by high-ranking military officials (well-regarded by many as the most trusted observers in the world) it's become clear that in this era of true UFO/UAP/NHI Disclosure: we need a refined, **organized**, database of all proven UAP Encounters across the globe.

**CLEARANCE** is that service.

Split into individual CASES -- we at _Clearance_ have devised a simple, accesible, user-friendly web based application to handle the maelstrom of information that's come our way since Leslie Kean & Ralph Blumenthal first published their article in the _New York Times_ in 2017 confirming the existence of AATIP (the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program) within the United States' Department of Defense within the Pentagon.
